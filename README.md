# **Project Manifest: AutoFinance AI Agent**

### ***Intelligent Car Discovery & Financing Assistant***

## **1\. Executive Summary (Business Context)**

The Opportunity:  
Buying a vehicle in emerging markets like Egypt is a fragmented, high-friction experience. Customers face a disconnect between discovery (finding a car on disjointed listing sites) and transaction (calculating affordability and securing a loan).  
The Solution:  
The AutoFinance AI Agent is an autonomous "Financial Co-Pilot" that bridges this gap. Unlike standard chatbots, it is an agentic system capable of:

1. **Aggregating Market Data:** Real-time searching of fragmented marketplaces (e.g., Hatla2ee, Dubizzle) to find vehicles.  
2. **Enforcing Policy:** Retrieving internal credit rules (RAG) to ensure quoted interest rates match the user's risk profile.  
3. **Executing Transactions:** Calculating precise monthly installments and submitting formal loan applications to the core banking system.

**Business Value:**

* **Reduced Turnaround Time:** Instant pre-approval estimates vs. days of manual processing.  
* **Higher Conversion:** Users are captured at the moment of intent (finding the car).  
* **Trust:** Transparent "Show Your Work" UI builds confidence in the financial advice.
